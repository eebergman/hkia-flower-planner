# Hello I would like to introduce the [HKIA Flower Planning](https://eebergman.github.io/hkia-flower-planner/) web app. 

*I made this as a side project for myself, and I hope it is able to be of some use to others too.*

## What this app does.
This app allows you to plan out where you planted something, and WHY you planted it. 
Then it saves that information to your browser so you can reference it again later.

## What this app does not do.
The HKIA Flower Planning app does not predict what may grow where. The Flower Generator App already does a great job of that.

## Features
Select a plot to save the information you want about it
You can save small notes to each plot
See all information about a plot by hovering over it
You can "block" a plot by "Marking it Empty"
Each patch knows which flowers you are allowed to plant there
You can mark a plot as planned
Hide any patch or region by clicking on the named header
Save your data to the same browser
View the Greenhouse at any size
Feedback through the app
Should function with accessibility tools like screen readers. 
(If there is a problem with accessibility please use the Feedback button and at me here)

## Future Plans
Allow users access their data on more than one machine
Make mobile experience nicer.
Give users a way to limit drop downs to only flower combinations they already own.

One million "thank yous" to Meeve. Those maps rule and made programming the patches so easy.
